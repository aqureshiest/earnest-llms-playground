   "text": "I’m a HS senior with a 4.47 GPA and top 10% of my class. I’ve been accepted to all the colleges I want to go to, but I have to pay for school on my own. I’ve gotten a few scholarships to out of state schools but my cheapest in-state, PUBLIC school is still $89,000 for everything with scholarships taken off the cost. My mom makes too much money for me to get any aid from FAFSA and she’s not helping me at all. I genuinely don’t know if it’s realistic for me to even go to college now.\n\nI don’t know much about loans, how much you should realistically take out, etc. so any advice will be appreciated.\n\nEdit: Majoring in Psychology and planning to get a masters. I’m located in Colorado.\n\nSchools I’ve applied to:\nUniversity of Oregon, Oregon State, University of Boulder, Colorado State , James Madison, Southwestern University, Penn State, Reed college, Denison college, Carleton college, Michigan State, and Kansas State. \n\nBefore everyone goes crazy about app fees a lot of these were waived or just free. \n\nEdit 2: Just applied to community college everyone!\n\nEdit 3: Anybody reading this post in the future (today is March 27) I have committed to Oregon State. With my parents help, working over summer, and my scholarships I will finish with 45K or less in debt. I am doing their community college program so it’s saving me about $20K. I am not super bothered by this number, because if I make 60K coming out of college, I should be fine based on my calculations."

   "text": "Basically, my parents lied to me about their financial situation and can only really afford the first semester at the college I’m going to (I’m a rising freshman). It’s ~32k per year and they have around 47k total in the bank. They have no dedicated college savings. To make matters worse, I have a twin brother who’s going to the same college as me with the same $$$cost.\n\nI have 6k saved up from working, my brother has no savings. My parents make good money so our aid wasn’t that great (still grateful for what was given though, of course)\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I’d be okay if they told me straight up they didn’t want to/couldn’t pay for my/my brothers college. This issue now is that I’ve been totally blindsided because they have always insisted on paying for my college, and still are insisting they can afford it even though they clearly can’t. I feel like they’re gaslighting me and I have no idea what to do. \n\nShould I call the financial aid office and explain the situation? Right now that’s my plan, followed by probably either checking out my local community college or considering a gap year to work??\n\nBasically I’m kinda panicking lol. Advice? Or maybe I’m overreacting and they can actually pay????\n\nEdit to answer some questions bc wow there’s a lot of comments lmao:\n\n1. FAFSA + aid:\nI did fill out the FAFSA, but our EFC was fairly high so we didn’t get much aid. As for other types of aid, I can take out 5k in subs loans for the first year and I qualified for around 3k in grants, both of which I’m planning on doing (if I attend this school). Still, it’s extremely expensive, plus my brother didn’t get any grants. Unsub loans don’t feel like a good decision for me right now considering the amount I would I have to talk out, plus my parents don’t want to take out loans. Theyre saying they can pay everything themselves. \n\n2. By 47k in the bank:\nI mean that’s literally everything they have. They told me they have that much overall to spend, from retirement to everyday costs. We also have a 100k mortgage. This is why I’m so appalled at the idea of them paying for me and my bro lol (that has to be crazy, right?)\n\n3. It’s a complicated situation, I didn’t add this bc I didn’t think it was necessary but hopefully it adds some clarification/context:\nWe grew up broke and only in the last couple years did my Dad start making good money. My dad is also probably bipolar, he spends like crazy, (buying two cars within a couple months kinda spending). My mom has little to no control/knowledge over finances. This is another reason why I’m fairly confident they can’t pay, though they insist they can. My dad is the type of person to be too prideful/in denial to say he can’t pay for me and my bro’s college. I have tried multiple times to have an honest conversation but he gets angry and defensive. They haven’t given me an actual plan to how they’re paying; they get touchy when I ask and it ends with a fight, at least the last couple times I’ve brought the situation up. They also hate the idea of going to cc, like they would absolutely hate me for it (it’s what I wanted originally actually bc I didn’t want them to pay so much for college. I love both of them very much and don’t want them to have that pressure).\n\nI believe they’re lying because the first time I told my dad about the cost he started crying. He has said from the beginning of the college process I could go anywhere I wanted, he could afford anything (he’s still saying that) but that just can’t true, at least from what I understand from the information I’ve been able to get from my mom. That, and after multiple fights about our financial situation, he finally admitted that I would probably have to “take a break” between years at school. Knowing his spending habits, the amount in the bank, and his defensiveness along with that comment I believe he’s lying to me about being able to fully pay for me and my bro’s college, but is too prideful/ashamed to fully admit it and allow me to go to cc. (He absolutely hates cc.)\n\n4. The school I’m attending + and the price:\nIt’s a low prestige, in-state school I live right next to. It’s the safety of safeties at my high school lol. It’s the lowest cost school I was accepted to, too. The 32k is the net cost, the tuition itself is way less than that, around 10k. If I gave the wrong number or anything I apologize. If I didn’t, I have no idea why it’s so expensive, I thought most US colleges cost about that much in total. I’m happy to hear they usually aren’t, but in my case this is the best I have. I’ll contact the financial aid office and ask questions about our cost/the aid.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThank you to everyone who commented and gave advice or empathy. After reading through the comments, my plan will be to talk with my parents and my brother one more time about finances, and really try to detail a plan on how to finance our college. Im hoping they will be able to have a calm conversation with me. I will talk to them about my local cc and the two year transfer program they have. Im also okay with taking a gap year to work! Id probably like that, actually, lol, it’s just my parents are horrified by that idea. Anyway, I’ll sit down with them and go from there!\n\nAgain, thanks so much everybody!"

   "text": "So I got into an argument with my mom last night. My mom told me I won’t get any financial aid from any colleges I apply to because despite constantly saying she’s “barely middle class”, struggling as a single mother, being told my entire childhood we couldn’t do certain extracurriculars or get certain things other kids had because “that’s too expensive”, and telling me I need to get a job to help support her, she tells me she makes a lot of money (90k a year) and I’m silly for thinking we struggle. I didn’t know her salary until yesterday. She also said it’s ridiculous I’m trying to get merit aid because “you want money for doing what you’re supposed to do in school” (despite later saying she’d think I was crazy if I didn’t try). Despite knowing I’d go to college, she never saved up for me, which I’m not mad at her for but I’m screwed if this is how she acts about finances in general. I’m really scared she’s not going to fill out the FAFSA because she hates talking about finances and seems to think it’s not even worth trying to get financial aid, despite most of the net price calculators I’ve entered her financial info into saying I’d still get a lot of aid. But if I can’t get her to fill out the FAFSA, I can’t get any of that, and it’s becoming increasingly likely she might refuse to fill out the FAFSA.\n\nI need to know some way I can pay for college. It can be as weird as possible, I just have to get out of here. I live in a super small town, there’s no good jobs, no opportunities, I can’t get stuck here. I really don’t want to have to do sex work (although that’s kind of what my mom’s been pushing me towards by saying she “wouldn’t shame me if I sold foot pics or became a stripper”, despite me constantly saying I hate the idea of both.) and I just. I don’t know. Is there some weird super niche side gig I can get into to pay for college? Like, feather dusting dog paws or something?? Community college isn’t an option because the nearest one is an hour total drive everyday and it’s expensive, even for a community college. Military isn’t an option because I have disabilities that would disqualify me from serving. If it means anything, I have a 3.8 GPA, I’m going to take the SAT soon and am aiming for at least a 1500. I’m an all honors and AP student."

My parents are from a 3rd world country and didn't know how debt worked but being from an ethnic family, not going to college was NOT an option. My other parent (estranged) is legally obliged to give me half a grand a month until I turn 21, but I have been notified that the payments will probably continue until I graduate. Usually this money goes to groceries and school supplies and I'm left over with average ~200 a month, but lately it has been hard to save up because I keep having emergencies. \n\nI'm a junior at my state university with my predicted graduation date in 2024 and I am doing an unpaid art gallery and museum internship with my school that hopefully will lead into a paid part time job. I am doing a fine arts degree that has given me the chance to exhibit and establish connections, and I have an academic minor in art history. \n\nCurrently I have 60k in debt with a projection of 80k after interest and I have no idea how to start paying it off. I hope to get a full time job in gallery or museum work once I graduate with the experience I'm gaining right now. Is there a certain amount of money I should be setting aside per month to help me go towards the monthly payments once they start? Is 50-100 enough? Should I open a bank account that grows the savings via interest? I only have 1 account open which is why it is hard to maintain my finances. I don't have a credit card but I do have a very good credit score as I have been enrolled and paid off small things using those payment apps and programs online. \n\nI also wanted to look into TA'ing for the summer if possible which would be everyday for 4 weeks.

I know scholarships which I will apply to but my gpa is low atm, but it won’t be when I get into a university. Is there any like ways I might not know about? Or will I just have to deal with massive debt."

   "text": "Hello! I am currently a freshman at my local community college. My original plan was to stay here for two years and then transfer to a university, to save a little bit of money.\n\nUnfortunately, living with my parents has been very rocky and it’s getting worse by the day. I won’t delve too much into the situation (reports to CPS, suicide attempts, blah blah blah) but I really just want to get out of here as soon as possible.\n\nAnyways, my parents are currently not helping pay for my tuition. They promised the kids (I have two older siblings) that they had a college fund set aside for each of us. They gave my brother and sister a lot of money (not sure how much exactly, but in the thousands) as well as completing the FAFSA for them to assist them further.\n\nUnfortunately, my parents refuse to fill out the FAFSA for me. They are… how should I word this… anti-government?? They are against giving the government their information for some reason, even though they did it for my brother and sister (and they still do their taxes lmao). And no, I cannot change their minds. I already tried to no avail. I was recently offered a student aide position at my current school. For students working on campus their tuition is cut by almost half. I couldn’t take the job because my parents refused to fill out the FAFSA, which was required in the final paperwork by my college in order to work there.\n\nI’ve worked part-time since I was a freshman in high school. My first year of community college was just under $12,000 (without the FAFSA. So much for being cheaper). I spent all of my life savings on my first year here. I literally only have a few hundred dollars left in my bank account.\n\nWhen I mentioned I was thinking about transferring one year early, my mother said she and my father will not financially support me at all anymore. Meaning, they will take the money out of my college fund and, I don’t know, go on vacation with the money or something. They don’t want me being “brainwashed” by the professors at university and instead want to be able to watch me at home so I don’t turn into a liberal LOL (you probably understand why I want to leave now).\n\nI really need some advice on what I can do. I desperately want to leave, but I have barely any money. I work a minimum wage job about 10-15 hours a week, because my hours were recently cut. And no, I cannot get a new job, because my family only owns one car and my mom refuses to let me drive it and she refuses to drive me further than a mile to my job, because she says it is wasting her time :/\n\nThank you for taking the time to read!\n\nEdit: Yup. You read it right: $12,000. The community college I am attending is technically in the county next to the one I live in, so I am paying out-of-district tuition. Why? My parents forced me to since it is supposedly “better” than the one near me."

My mom has a job where she makes a little over 100k a year, but adjusted for taxes and the cost of living in Seattle, it ends up not being not a significant amount of take home pay. My tuition ends up being about $13,000 for three quarters (excluding books) and housing around $1,400 a month all of which I pay for myself. I find it completely infuriating that because of my age and the fact that I don’t have dependents, FAFSA considers me a dependent student and bases my aid on what my mom makes. I think with the cost of living and inflation, it is unrealistic and unreasonable to expect parents to pay or pay for significant sums of their children’s college education (especially with how expensive tuition has become), and since I am completely providing for myself, I don’t understand why my mom’s income gets to disqualify me from so many grants or loan options. I just think it is completely unfair how hard I’ve had to work to stay enrolled in college. I also feel like my grades could have been so much better over the last two years if I didn’t have to spend so much of my time outside of school working instead of studying. I know I could take out loans but with interest rates the way they are, I’m worried about being able to repay them in a reasonable amount of time. As for not living at home, I choose to not live at home because the environment was not healthy. My brother and mom fight constantly in a way that is super disruptive and which created a super tumultuous house, so I moved out a month after graduating high school. I’m starting to feel so burnt out and stressed with all the economic chaos in the US. If there is anyone that has been/is in a similar situation any advice is appreciated:)"

   "text": "I’m posting this as I am stressed and in need of advice. I’ll start with the background info. I am a first gen college student in a very large family. My parents make enough money to scrape by, but according to the government we make too much to get much aid. I qualify for a pell grant but it’s about $900 a semester. They are completely unable to offer any financial help for my college as I have too many siblings that they need to take care of. I have had a job making around minimum wage for the last 2 years, but it is to help support my family financially, and I don’t have much money to put towards my education. My ultimate issue is that i’m terrified of student loan debt. However, I’m not sure that I have any other option. I have worked very hard to get good grades and excel not only academically but with my extracurricular life as well. I have taken honors courses, as well as AP and dual credit. Yet, it seems like it wasn’t good enough. I applied to 14 schools, and although I was accepted into 12 of them, there is nowhere that I could go for free. Even the several private universities I applied to (for the financial aid purposes) have given me some of the best scholarships they offer, but I would still have to pay upwards of $20k+ a year. My in-state schools aren’t any cheaper, and my financial aid packages have all been very disappointing. Community college isn’t an option either, as the one near me doesn’t offer the program I am looking for.  \nConstantly seeing people getting judged, very harshly, about accumulating debt in undergrad has made me very stressed. I’m afraid that I worked so hard in school for years for nothing, because I have no choice but to either take on the student loan debt, or not go. I spoke to my high school’s college counselor and she made me feel terrible, and made me feel bad for not being wealthy and that I will need to take out student loans. I want to become a CAA, which will require about 2.5 years of graduate school on top of undergraduate school. I really want to go to college and get away from my hometown, as none of my family members have done it. I’m just not sure what other choice I have in the matter and i’m very stressed about my future. Please do not respond to this post with any judgement, I am simply seeking advice about something I am not educated in, and appreciate the time taken to read this."

The main reasons I’m considering these schools are to get out of my home state, pursue international study opportunities (which I believe my state school does have, but not certain), and to be honest, to live somewhere cold! Tbh, it seems like all these places are higher cost of living than where my state school would be as well.\n\nMy question is, at what point do the opportunities these schools provide outweigh the $50,000 price tag? I honestly just can’t even visualize that much money or what being in debt like that would do for my future. I don’t have a career field, or even a major, in mind. My mom will help with the costs but still, $50k??? I’d inevitably be going into debt.

But I'm equally scared and excited and I'M the one who chose to do it this way. I think I can handle it PERSONALLY but the biggest issue is FINANCIALLY. \n\nPitt gave me $30k in aid that I've already accepted, so I have that in the bag. However, I still have to pay $16k for the whole school year. I really don't think it's possible for my parents and I to pay all of that, seriously. I don't have a job yet (but I'm trying to become a tutor and work my ass off with $20+/hr conditions, IF POSSIBLE. This is all a mess) and my parents made like $60k this year PROBABLY. They don't usually share financial stuff but I think it totals to around that much. We are financially struggling a LOT right now. My parents don't share the details, but I can tell. This could probably help me as much as it stresses me out...?\n\nI know college is supposed to be super expensive anyway (boo capitalism), but the idea of putting myself through this risky situation and possibly throwing $16k down the drain if it doesn't work out is BAD. I CANNOT let my parents try to pay all that for me and it's increasingly obvious that I can't supply that for myself, either. I also applied to Carnegie and got waitlisted \\[ basically permanently ;( \\] but their financial aid made it to where I only had to pay $3k for the year, which is mouth-wateringly good. I think that standard is a little high for out-of-state public university tuition but *damn*, the difference is STARK. \n\nI googled it and some people say that you CAN ask for more aid from a school if you provide the proper documents. However, I don't know if Pitt would want to provide more considering all that I have already; I'm still going to try though, because the worst that could happen is a no, I think. My MAIN plan right now is to obviously get a REMOTE job (limited car access and I live in rural South) and try to communicate with the school and see if I can get more aid.  Most scholarships seem like data mining scams to me, but I GUESS I should apply for some legit ones nonstop and just see if I get some $$? My dad's trying to get some private loans or whatever, but I don't know anything about that. \n\nI always talk too much on these things and I'm terrible at asking for advice, but here's the gist: **I'm asking for a general idea of what I should be doing to handle that large leftover tuition, be it reducing the amount with more aid or signing up for a good payment plan or selling my soul for thousands, IDK!** (And please don't talk me out of the whole out-of-state college thing, I realize I'm in over my head but it's too late and I'm stubborn about my education; no way I'm doing a gap year or going to some shitty college in the South when living here makes me miserable!)

   "text": "I'm not really sure about how private loans work, except they can screw you over. I'm planning to attend a private school where it's 60k a year but it'll be down to 20k after grants and aid. 12.5k will be federal loans so I need roughly 8k out of pocket. I can't afford that and I was planning to get a private loan for it. I've read that some private loans are suited for school where you don't start paying until after graduation. What should I look for in a loan and how should I approach this in general?\n\nI've read that a general guideline is to not borrow more than one year of starting salary. I'm going to be majoring in software engineering where the starting is fairly high compared to other jobs. Currently, I think I'm hovering around 20k in federal loans. I'll probably be attending the private school for roughly two years, so \\~40k federal + private."

   "text": "So yeah, the title says what I’m talking about. For background history, I took two classes in 2012 right after high school. With multiple reasons of untreated ADHD, not prepared, and cared for my terminally ill grandmother. I had to withdraw from the classes that were excused with a psychiatric letter from my psychiatrist. \n\nNow fast forward to 11 years later, I applied for college again and received my financial aid to start three classes. I obtained a 4.0 GPA along with excellent grades of all A’s. This is the proudest I’ve ever been with myself since I worked so hard to obtain this being a single mother of 2 and working 40 hours a week. \n\nI received an email stating that I didn’t met SAP requirements and I’m now on suspension until I file a appeal. I talked with the student help center and they were stunned at why this would be happening. We concluded that it could be from when I attended college over a decade ago and it’s counting towards my time here. I’m not going to lie, I’m freaking out because I feel defeated that I did all this hard work for absolutely nothing because of the system. \n\nI speak with my student advisor on Monday. I forwarded the email to him and asked what exactly our plan is to appeal this decision. I’ve started writing my appeal on why I failed the first time and it makes me so angry that I have to do this. Makes no sense to me since I was never told about this and I received my financial aid the first time.\n\nSo I’m just venting about this and hopefully see if others had the same issue with this SAP requirement system."

By dropping all 3 courses I will be put on Financial Aid Suspension until it’s decided I’m committed to school. The only way to avoid Financial Aid Suspension is to file an appeal. My appeal will be denied unless I have a valid reason (w/documentation) to be dropping them. I don’t think depression counts as a valid reason and need advice on how to have my appeal accepted. \n\n\n\nSo to keep a long story as short as possible, I’ve messed up BAD this semester. I haven’t been in a good headspace for a few months now and have screwed myself academically this semester to the point of no return. Because of this, I have no other choice but to drop all 3 of my courses. If I do not drop them, my gpa will drastically drop… my gpa currently is a 3.7 but that 3.7 is based on the 3 courses I took last semester. I’m attending community college and hope to transfer to a uni in the near future so having my gpa drop that low is not an option. The big problem with this is that my school is getting paid for via Federal Pell Grant, by dropping all 3 of my courses I will be put on Financial Aid Suspension until it’s decided that I’m actually committed to school. My one and only hope to avoid academic suspension is to file an appeal against being put on Financial Aid Suspension. I spoke with the Financial Aid department at my cc today and they told me to file the appeal asap, but that the only way my appeal will be accepted is if I have a good, valid reason (with documentation to prove said reason) to be dropping all my courses. My problem is that I have a feeling that depression induced laziness/avoidance doesn’t count as a valid reason. I can’t pay for my classes and want to avoid putting myself in anymore debt until I transfer to a uni where I’ll really need to get loans. \n\nSo my question is, does anyone have any advice for what I can do to hopefully have my appeal accepted? Does anyone have experience filing a financial aid suspension appeal or any experience being in a situation like mine? ANY and ALL advice is appreciated and welcomed. I know this sounds like a “you dug your own grave” situation which to an extent it definitely is and I take full responsibility for that. I have genuinely had some specific circumstances recently that have contributed to me just completely avoiding my work. I have been avoiding life as whole recently not just school.\n\n\n\nTLDR: Im paying for school with Federal Pell Grant, I have no choice but to drop all 3 of my courses this semester.

   "text": "Do not make the same mistake I did. When I first started college I was fresh out of highschool and a depressed mess because of my various experiences in it. Zoom because of COVID in my first year of college did not help. I dropped a few classes over my first couple years in college because I couldn't handle the workload and had no motivation and wanted to die, and, since very little (if anything at all) was ever explained to me, a newly turned adult who knew nothing about finances and the world, I pretty much never replaced these classes. So instead of taking 5 classes a semester I would take 4. Also, considering that in my highschool it was very difficult to switch teachers, all of a sudden I had all this power thrown at me and the ability to switch and drop whenever I wanted with the click of a few buttons online. With all this newfound power, I didn't know what to do with it. Throughout highschool I had a few AWFUL teachers that made me hate my life considerably for quite a while. I never wanted to go through that again. I just didn't really know what I was doing and assumed I would be fine and that it was OK to just drop a class or two here and there. I was wrong, and it will cost me dearly.\n\nBecause of dropping too many classes, I have to take 2 summer semesters (2 classes per semester), and graduate a few months late. That in-and-of-itself isn't too terrible, but it still sucks pretty hard. The real loss I am taking is having to pay back an extra $8,000 since no scholarships will be applied to my summer courses. That's a LOT of work hours that I will have to do in the future that will not be rewarded like they could be. That's a a couple vacations to another country right there for maybe a week or two per country.\n\nWhen I found this out I was fucking furious. I'm warning you all now to PLEASE not make the same mistake I did. It sucks so hard and I feel like I was scammed so hard for never having someone properly explain this to me. I understand that technically it is my responsibility to speak to financial aid, and figure this stuff out myself, but at the same time...I DID. Before I dropped classes I always made sure to speak to financial aid and make sure it would not affect my federal aid. They always said it wouldn't but NO ONE ever uttered a word to me of making sure I replace those classes with another so as to avoid this kind of situation that I am in now. It just blows my mind how long this flew over my head for. Part of me wants to blame myself, but I feel like it would just be unfair to myself to do that considering I was an 18 year old idiot straight out of highschool with no clue what's going on anymore and not the faintest idea of finances. Personally, I really think that it was my university's job to properly explain this to me, but they didn't. They either straight up neglected this unwritten responsibility, or they purposely didn't tell me because they love people like me who don't know what they're doing and owe them thousands of extra dollars. And considering my college is struggling financially, I wouldn't be shocked.\n\nFinancial aid needs to have its own required class, I truly think this. And students should all have their own personal financial aid advisor. Considering I am paying tens of thousands of dollars for my education, this is the least they could do so I don't make mistakes like this. I'm so deeply ashamed of my university for setting me up for financial failure, and also mad at myself for not realizing sooner. I also wish stupid elective courses that no one cares about didn't have to be what costs me this $8,000...because as I am right now, im on course for graduating 100% on time because I have most of my requirements fulfilled. Literally pointless elective courses are what is killing me. They need to stop requiring 5 classes per semester and knock a couple elective's off. It's absurd."

You can see who has won scholarships and schools they attend (I've seen many from UF). She just signed up a few weeks ago so no wins yet but fingers crossed. Hope this can be helpful to someone.

   "text": "Hey y'all! I have since graduated college about 3 years ago but I'm making this post because for my significant other who is considering going back to school. When they were 18, they didn't particularly gravitate towards school/studying and with some parental pressure, went on to become a welder instead and has done a lot of machinist work. They also took some dual-enrollment courses during high school, and I believe that they almost have an associate's degree.\n\nRecently, I think they've come across some regrets with not following a four-year bachelor's degree pathway considering career mobility, earning potential, etc. (they're 25 now) and are seriously considering pursuing an engineering degree—most likely going from community college then transferring to a larger university. They are really worried about the financial aspect(s): yes, there are loans/FAFSA/grants/potential scholarships for tuition, but for the rest of expenses, I don't think my partner would want to live in dorms, and with no income, it'll be hard to afford rent, food, car payments, insurance, etc. We also don't live together at the moment since I'm in medical school myself and with a roommate. They're already thinking of working for the next year to try and save up. It's just a big decision and a big investment.\n\nDo any other non-traditional college grads have any advice on affording living expenses during school? Or really any other helpful tips/advice/words of encouragement? Thanks y'all :)"

I did apply for small private scholarships but that may not even make a dent in that hefty yearly tuition. I did have a life change and a death of my mom- which means my EFC will be different last year but does anyone have any tips on how to talk to the college to get the cost down? this is my first time doing this so I’m kinda clueless."

My thing is I was apparently still registered for the college classes while I was at that point a High school dropout and my GPA was definitely to low for duel enrollment programs…… I feel like I could dispute it and not have to pay because there’s no way a high school drop out who wasn’t even currently registered for school could logically attend those classes in the first place. I just need advice on the situation, they turned me over to a private attorney, should I try to dispute it? Or just go on a payment plan for the 1k?"

Which resulted in me being unable to focus on my schoolwork. Leading to me not reaching my academic requirements. Unfortunately, that means that I had to pay off the $8,000+ balance that my last semester costed by myself. It took me an entire year of working two jobs and asking for thousands of dollars out of stepfather's account. \n\nNow that the semester is over, I performed a lot best that I've had in all of my semesters at that school. I may not have taken me off of academic probation, however it put me in a good position to get off next semester. Anyways it looks like I will not be able to return this upcoming Fall 2023 semester. This is due to me having a $9,000+ balance hold on my student account. My financial aid never went through due to me missing a document on my appeal form. A form that my advisor needed to turn in. Unfortunately, the advisor that I had since the start resigned without me being informed. So, for the past year, I had no idea who my new advisor was nor was I able to find out and sign up for an appointment since my student log-in was invalid. You know, because I wasn't a student for a while anymore. \n\nSo now I'm desperately trying to get in contact with somebody over at FAFSA o quickly resolve this before the deadline hit to no longer distribute aid for the past semester. If I'm too late, I'm in MAJOR trouble and I'm already WAY behind in my curriculum already. \n\nPLEASE HELP ME OUT GUYS, IF YOU CAN!!!"

With bad ADHD and being on the spectrum, the more hours a day I can focus on a single thing, the better. \n\nHowever, I think I may have messed up putting my current salary (\\~40k) on my FAFSA, because I am not getting any federal assistance for school. I also won't get any money from my family, and I don't have any savings, nor am I really able to save. I was already planning on taking out a lot in loans, but now it's feeling a bit overwhelming. I know I can try to get some scholarships and payment plans for tuition costs, but I'm worried about covering food and housing. \n\nDoes anyone have any pointers or information that I should consider? I'm confident that I will find work after school and be able to deal with the loans, but am I going to be struggling to stay housed while in school? Should I maybe not do this and try school again in a few years when I may be able to save a bit more? I really want to go to school and graduate but I don't feel I'm able to work full time and do that. \n\nThanks in advance for the help, I'm stressed!"
